## üì¶ Setup Instructions

> ‚ö†Ô∏è These configs are tailored for my environment (CachyOS + Hyprland). YMMV if you're using another distro or DE.

1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kaezrr/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
```

2. Symlink the folders or copy them to your home directory. I recommend using stow or a dotfile manager of your choice.

Example with stow:

```bash
stow nvim zsh tmux kitty hypr waybar dunst fuzzel
```

3. Make sure all dependencies are installed (Hyprland, kitty, dunst, etc.).
