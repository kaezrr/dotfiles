# .files

Personal dotfiles for a minimal and highly customized Linux setup, built around [Hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland), Wayland-native tools, and the **Kanagawa** colorscheme.  
This rice tries to focus a lot on minimalism, performance and efficiency as much as reasonable. I hope you like it
